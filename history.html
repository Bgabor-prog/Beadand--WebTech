        <b><span style="color:darkred">EA Sports</span></b> announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label. 
        When the series began with FIFA International Soccer on the Sega Mega Drive in late 1993,
        it was notable for being the first to have an official license from FIFA, the world governing body of football. 
        The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, 
        UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA European Football Championship, as well as a series of football management titles.

    <h2>Early Years</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        While FIFA 95 did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams, 
        FIFA 96 pushed the boundaries. For the first time with real player names by obtaining the FIFPro license, 
        the PlayStation, PC, 32X and Sega Saturn versions used EA's "Virtual Stadium" engine, with 2D sprite players moving around a real-time 3D stadium. 
        FIFA 97 improved on this with polygonal models for players and added an indoor soccer mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with FIFA: Road to World Cup 98. 
        This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, 
        World Cup 98 was EA's first officially licensed tournament game.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        FIFA games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor.
         As the console market expanded, FIFA was challenged directly by other titles, most notably  <b><span style="color:darkred">Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer (PES)</span></b> series. 
         The rivalry between both franchises since the 1990s has been considered the "greatest rivalry" in the history of sports video games. 
         While FIFA initially had a more "arcade-style" approach, PES was more of a football simulation video game series with "faster-paced tactical play" and more varied emergent gameplay, 
         which led to PES rivaling FIFA in sales during the 2000s. EA responded by borrowing gameplay elements from PES in order to improve FIFA, 
         which led to FIFA pulling ahead commercially by a significant margin in the early 2010s. Both FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer have a large following, 
         but FIFA sales were rising by as much as 23 percent year-on-year in the early 2010s.

    <h2>Middle Years</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        By 2000, the FIFA series had sold more than 16 million units worldwide, making it the best-selling association football video game series.
        In 2010, the FIFA series had sold over 100 million copies, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable EA Sports title.
        With FIFA 12 selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its 27 September North American debut in 2011, EA Sports dubbed it "the most successful launch in EA Sports history".

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        In 2012, EA Sports signed Lionel Messi to the FIFA franchise, luring him away from the competitor Pro Evolution Soccer. 
        Messi's likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of FIFA Street. 
        In 2013, the Spanish professional women's footballer Vero Boquete started a petition on Change.org, which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the FIFA series. 
        The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours. FIFA 16, released on 25 September 2015, included female national teams.

    <h2>Nowdays</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        In 2018, Steve Boxer of The Guardian called FIFA 18 "the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around" and "football [video] games' 
        equivalent of the Premier League". He praised the game's FIFA Ultimate Team, which "encourages you to purchase Panini-sticker-like player packs to build up a dream team", 
        adding the series has "an excellent Journey mode that lets you control an aspiring pro and build him up to an international superstar, 
        and a Career mode that lets you control your favourite team on and off the field. The sixth best-selling video game franchise, by 2021, 
        the FIFA series had sold over 325 million copies.
