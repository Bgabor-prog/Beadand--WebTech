    <h2>FIFA International Soccer</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: David Platt and Piotr Świerczewski (Packie Bonner and Ruud Gullit in some versions)</li>
        <li>Released for: Mega Drive/Genesis, PC, DOS, Amiga, Sega CD (as FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition), 3DO, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy</li>
        <li>Release dates: 15 December 1993 (Mega Drive), 1994 (ports)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Known as EA Soccer during development and sometimes subsequently also known as FIFA '94,
        the first game in the series was released for the Sega Mega Drive in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. 
        This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view (Kick Off), 
        side view (European Club Soccer), or bird's eye view (Tehkan World Cup and Sensible Soccer). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. 
        A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, 
        replacing Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition, and staying there for a full six months. Mega placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.
        The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title "FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition" it includes some features used in the next title, 
        and is a highly polished version of the original. This version was ranked #7 on the Mega list of the Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time.
        The game on the 3DO console sported pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version Also, the game is playable on the PlayStation 2 version of FIFA 06.
        It was made in celebration for the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in the United States especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, 
        despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament:
        Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The game was called International Soccer so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, 
        after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game.
    </p>
    
    <h2>FIFA 95</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Erik Thorstvedt (Alexi Lalas in some versions)</li>
        <li>Released for: Mega Drive/Genesis</li>
        <li>Release date: 10 November 1994</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using the same engine with only minor touch-ups, FIFA 95 introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany's Bundesliga, 
        Italy's Serie A, Spain's La Liga, England's Premier League, France's Ligue 1, Netherlands' Eredivisie and the United States. Most of the leagues have team lineups 
        based on the 1993–94 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still have generic players, many of them even returning from the previous game. 
        The USA League consists of teams and players from the A-League, the country's second division – subsequent editions would feature "artificial" division one leagues, 
        a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when Major League Soccer was included for the first time. In addition, 
        the Brazilian league contained only teams from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, with the exception of Internacional, 
        from Rio Grande do Sul—it would not be until FIFA 07 that Campeonato Brasileiro represented the country. 
        The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original FIFA International Soccer. This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in 
        more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only FIFA 64 and certain versions of the FIFA Manager series share this distinction).
    </p>

    <h2>FIFA 96</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Ioan Ovidiu Sabau and Jason McAteer (European version)</li>
        <li>Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy</li>
        <li>Release date: 30 September 1995</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is the first FIFA game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC versions, using technology called "Virtual Stadium". 
        It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. 
        However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in FIFA 99), 
        and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters (Major League Soccer had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game's release, 
        but it would only start to appear in the games as of FIFA 2000). The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of FIFA 95's engine with new teams and graphics. 
        It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of 
        the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: Scottish Football League Premier Division, Allsvenskan and Super League Malaysia, a lineup that would stay for 
        the next two editions as well. This was also the first FIFA game to have a proper introduction.
    </p>

    <h2>FIFA 97</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: David Ginola (European version); Bebeto (rest of the world)</li>
        <li>Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Game Boy</li>
        <li>Release date: 30 November 1996</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The biggest change in FIFA '97 was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players, with motion capture provided by David Ginola. 
        The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia.
         These versions also feature commentary by John Motson, partnered by Andy Gray, with Des Lynam introducing the matches.
    </p>

    <h2>FIFA: Road to World Cup 98</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Roy Lassiter (USA); David Beckham (UK); Paolo Maldini (Italy); David Ginola (France); Andreas Möller (Germany); Raúl (Spain)</li>
        <li>Title song: "Song 2" by Blur</li>
        <li>Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Boy</li>
        <li>Release date: 8 November 1997</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, 
        improved artificial intelligence, a "Road to World Cup" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time.
         The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. 
         Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee's strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment.
        Additionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule is properly implemented. 
        In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards.
         The 32-bit version of FIFA 98 corrects this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly 
         to where the player in the offside position was.
        FIFA 98 was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack, with "Song 2" by Blur used as the intro track for the game. 
        It was the last FIFA game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on.

    <h2>FIFA 2000</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Sol Campbell (UK); Vincenzo Montella (Italy); Pep Guardiola (Spain); Emmanuel Petit (France);

        <li>Title song: "It's Only Us" by Robbie Williams</li>
        <li>Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Game Boy Color</li>
        <li>Release date: 26 October 1999</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 "classic" teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends.
        It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious "American" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece,
         Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray is not present in the game).
        The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an
         attempt to give more "emotion" to the 3D player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.
        The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to 
        play against a retro side from 1904, the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the "Rest of the World" 
        section (they were in the Football League First Division at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, 
        teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004).

    </ul>
    <p>
        This title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. 
        Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, 
        like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire Austrian Bundesliga and Korean K-League as playable leagues for the first time, albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League. A "hack" feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise on a 6th generation video game console in USA and Europe.
        The PlayStation version of FIFA 2001 received a "Gold" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), 
        indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

    <p>
        For FIFA Football 2002, power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. 
        The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs 
        such as PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the "Rest of World" header). This game also features, for the first time, 
        the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular 
        competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup 
        (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.
        Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones' qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose 
        confederations are not represented in full).
        FIFA Football 2002 was the final game in the main series to feature the Japanese national team, as the Japan Football Association would sell its exclusive 
        rights to Konami during 2002, thereby depriving not only FIFA, but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA's World Cup spin-offs),
        from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though) until FIFA 17.

    <h2>FIFA Football 2003</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids (in the United States, only Landon Donovan appeared)
        </li>

        <li>Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Mobile phone</li>
        <li>Release date: 5 November 2002</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FIFA Football 2003 added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated DirectX 7 graphics used in FIFA 2001 and 2002, 
        and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's 
        top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, 
        as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's "Freestyle Control" which allows the user to flick the ball on and 
        lay it off to teammates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. 
        An Xbox version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2, whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped. FIFA Football 2003 was also the first game 
        in the series to use the EA Trax. EA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles.
    </p>

    <h2>FIFA Football 2004</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Thierry Henry, Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldinho
        </li>
        <li>Title song: "Red Morning Light" by Kings of Leon</li>
        <li>Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Mobile phone</li>
        <li>Release date: 18 October 2003</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in FIFA Football 2004 is secondary divisions, 
        which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, 
        but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed "off the ball" was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously 
        control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. 
        Another key feature is "Football Fusion", which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from TCM in FIFA 2004. 
        This is also the first FIFA game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico 
        (América, Toluca, Monterrey and UNAM; a fifth team, Tigres UANL, is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina (Boca Juniors and River Plate). 
        The title sequence, featuring Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Alessandro Del Piero, was filmed at St James' Park, the home ground of Newcastle United.

        <li>RRelease date: 11 October 2004</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FIFA Football 2005 was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and avoid clashing with EA Sports'
        own FIFA Street. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. 
        The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform
        real-life tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full Mexican League. 
        The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who composed the FIFA Theme especially for the game, 
        using some sounds from the game such as artificial crowd noise and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. 
        The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut.
    </p>

    <h2>FIFA 06</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (in North America, Omar Bravo and Freddy Adu joined Ronaldinho on the cover)

        <li>Release date: 4 October 2005</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FIFA's developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of FIFA, claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play,
        having rewritten more than half the game's code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the "off the ball" system, 
        the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of "team chemistry" which determines how well team members play together. 
        This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from Match of the Day's John Motson and (more recently) Ally McCoist, who are replaced by ITV's 
        Clive Tyldesley and former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray, who had already worked in the series as guest commentator.
        One of the new features in FIFA 06 was a special "retro" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section,
        a memorable moments video compilation, which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the FIFA 06 developers, a video compilation with a
        retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the FIFA series which was titled as "FIFA 94".
        The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars.
        Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the "Fan Shop".
        The Xbox 360 version, titled FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup, featured only national teams and a brand-new engine taking advantage of the Xbox 360's graphical capabilities.
        It was the first FIFA game on a seventh-generation console.

    <h2>FIFA 07</h2>

        <li>Release date: 25 September 2006</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The main differences from the previous game are a new "Interactive Leagues" function, new stadia such as the new Wembley Stadium and Emirates Stadium, 
        and the ability to create custom teams and Turkcell Super League returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game's front-end and graphics 
        engine remain largely the same. The Xbox 360 version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version
        also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, 
        plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams. This was the last title released for the GameCube, Xbox and Game Boy Advance.

        <li>Release date: 27 September 2007</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FIFA 08 introduced a new game mode called "Be a Pro", in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger 
        club section including the League of Ireland, and the Hyundai A-League of Australia, for the first time. Unlike FIFA 06 and 07 however, FIFA 08 does not include 
        any memorable moments or season highlights. This edition introduced the Practice Arena Feature that allowed training and improving the dribbling, shooting, or practicing free
         kicks and penalties while on the practice pitch.
        It was the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 3 and Wii, the latter introducing motion controls for shooting, as well as 
        three mini-games that make use of the Wii Remote.

    <h2>FIFA 09</h2>

        <li>Release date: 3 October 2008</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FIFA 09 features a revamped collision system and an option for 10 versus 10 "Be a Pro" online matches, and the new "Adidas Live Season" feature, 
        which updates all the players' stats in a particular league based on the player's form in real life. Although the feature is activated through microtransactions, 
        gamers have access to one free league of their choice from the moment they activate the service to the end of the 2008–09 season. Online play has also been improved in 
        FIFA 09, with a feature called "FIFA 09 Clubs" allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online. 
        The game is the first in the FIFA series to feature user-controlled goal celebrations. FIFA 09 has met with generally positive reception from reviewers.
        Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray again provide the commentary in the English version. However, in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game,
         Tyldesley is replaced by Martin Tyler. For the first time, users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the PlayStation Store 
         (PlayStation 3) and Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox 360). Another option for the English language is Tyldesley and Andy Townsend.

        David Rutter, the line producer for FIFA 12, has promised "a revolutionary year for FIFA... especially in the gameplay department.
        The first screenshot was revealed on 11 April, featuring Brazilian midfielder Kaká running through the field.
        FIFA 12 is the first edition of the series to feature Arabic commentary. The Czech First League and Turkish Süper Lig are removed from the game 
        (though Turkish side Galatasaray is still featured) and a third Argentine team, Racing Club de Avellaneda, is added to the Rest of World bracket. 
        The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 were the main consoles for the game, and for the first time, the PC version was feature-identical. 
        In May, EA announced that a Nintendo 3DS version would be available, including career mode, 11 vs 11, street mode and Be a Pro, but excluding any online mode.
        On 27 May, it was confirmed that FIFA 12 would be released on PlayStation 2. On 7 June, it was confirmed that the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch will also be included 
        and others are to come in the next few months. On 11 July, photos of the Career Mode were released. During the demo launch on 13 September 2011,
        both FIFA 12 and Xbox Live were trending on social networking site Twitter. For the first time in the series, the game has been officially 
        ported to the Mac OS X operating system by TransGaming. In March 2012, FIFA Football was released as a launch title for the PS Vita, 
        which despite the different name was a port of FIFA 12.
        New features include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Player Impact Engine – a physics engine built to deliver real-world physicality in every interaction on the pitch
        </li>
        <li>Precision Dribbling – delivers a higher fidelity of touch on the ball for attacking players</li>

    <p>
        On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game is the first of the series compatible with Kinect and PlayStation Move, respectively. 
        The game also features the Saudi Professional League, the first time Arabic football is represented in the series 
        (while FIFA 2000 did include club teams from the Arab world, it was generic teams with non-distinctive uniforms). It is the only FIFA title to be released on the Wii U.
        New features include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Attacking Intelligence – Players automatically analyse space and think ahead making it potentially easier to break down the defence, 
            with Goalkeeping Intelligence also improved in similar ways
        </li>
        <li>Complete Dribbling – Precise 360-degree mobility with the ball allowing players to be more dangerous and creative during 1-on-1 confrontations</li>

    <p>
        For the newest generation of video game consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game showcases a new engine, Ignite, which allows not only for graphical enhancements, like shifting weather conditions and dynamic environment, but also for changes in gameplay, with features like Human Intelligence (which brings the AI closer to real player behavior) and True Player Motion (which gives the players more realistic animations). Also, all versions have an all-new Co-op Seasons online mode, in which two players can play a season for the same team. As for the team selection, the game features, for the first time, the top leagues from Argentina, Chile and Colombia, the first time South American leagues other than the Brazilian one are featured in a FIFA game.
        The PC version does not feature the Ignite engine (which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases); 
        rather than that, they will feature the Impact engine, same as used in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions 
        (which the PC versions have been using since 11), with minor improvements. This is reportedly due to Electronic Arts' claims that most PC players 
        do not own a machine powerful enough for the Ignite engine, therefore it would only be featured in the next edition.
        This is the last FIFA game to be released for the PlayStation Portable and FIFA 14 would eventually become the last PlayStation 2 game produced 
        and released in South America. The game features new signature goal celebrations from a number of players 
        including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Lionel Messi, among others.

        This is the last title for the Wii and handhelds. The Windows version used the new engine (Ignite Engine) for the first time, which is the same as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. 
        The first edition released during EA's deal with the English Premier League as Official Sports Technology Partner. 
        This deal allows all 20 Premier League stadiums to be included in the game as well as official Premier League scoreboards and television graphics.
        FIFA's exclusive access to Premier League clubs allowed detailed photography of all 20 stadiums so they could be authentically recreated, with the cheers, 
        chants and sounds of more than 20 Premier League matches also recorded.[45] Since this game any club promoted to the Premier League has had their stadium added. 
        Due to licensing troubles with Brazilian players, this was the first game in the main series that did not feature a Brazilian league in any form. 
        FIFA 15 also brought back the Turkish Süper Lig to the series after it was initially removed with the release of FIFA 12.

    <p>
        FIFA 16 was the first title in the series to include female athletes and national teams. After the complications in the previous edition, 
        ome Brazilian teams agreed to lend their visual identities (badges, names and kits) to the game, but no such agreement was reached with players due to
        the decentralization of player image rights in Brazil; as a result, the Brazilian teams are placed in the Rest of World block (being given their own
        incomplete league slot in subsequent editions), with their rosters comprised completely by fictional players, unlike all other clubs and most national teams.

        A new feature in FIFA 20 titled Volta Football is a renaissance of previous FIFA Street-style elements, providing a variance on the traditional 11v11 gameplay. 
        It is set to include the ability to play 3v3 Rush (no goalkeepers), 4v4, 4v4 Rush, 5v5 and professional futsal modes. The game places an emphasis on skill 
        and independent play, rather than tactical or team-play. The player is also able to customise their own player; aside from selecting gender, the players will 
        also have a variety of clothes and accessories to choose from, ranging from shoes and clothes to hats and tattoos. The traditional 11v11 mode has also changed,
         with more 1-on-1s encouraged, more off-the-ball space creation, as well as new penalty and free-kick mechanics. Juventus were not in FIFA 20 as they signed a
          partnership deal with PES 2020; they were called Piemonte Calcio in FIFA 20.[64] Liverpool announced a "long-term" partnership with FIFA.[64] Since the start 
          of the 2020 season, EA Sports signed the deal with CONMEBOL to become the latest exclusive partner of the CONMEBOL club competitions which include the CONMEBOL 
          Libertadores and Recopa as well as the second-tier CONMEBOL Sudamericana, available on the content update on March 2020
